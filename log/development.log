DEPRECATION WARNING: You attempted to assign a value which is not explicitly `true` or `false` (53) to a boolean column. Currently this value casts to `false`. This will change to match Ruby's semantics, and will cast to `true` in Rails 5. If you would like to maintain the current behavior, you should explicitly handle the values you would like cast to `false`.

DEPRECATION WARNING: You attempted to assign a value which is not explicitly `true` or `false` (52) to a boolean column. Currently this value casts to `false`. This will change to match Ruby's semantics, and will cast to `true` in Rails 5. If you would like to maintain the current behavior, you should explicitly handle the values you would like cast to `false`.

DEPRECATION WARNING: You attempted to assign a value which is not explicitly `true` or `false` (8) to a boolean column. Currently this value casts to `false`. This will change to match Ruby's semantics, and will cast to `true` in Rails 5. If you would like to maintain the current behavior, you should explicitly handle the values you would like cast to `false`.
